    "## About  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This worksheet is your warm-up exercise to getting started with some python for finance, based on examples from the book.  It is also your warm-up with problem solving (no python required) and expressing your methods/answers using proper mathematical symbols and representations.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to always ensure that the notebook is trusted when you open it.  To do this, look at the top right hand side of the window for the **[Trusted / Not Trusted button]**.  If the notebook is not trusted, click the button to trust the notebook.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Read the instructions carefully, complete the tasks, and answer any questions.  Submit your notebook to Sakai as is detailed in the syllabus.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Important Notes\n",
    "  \n",
    "For clarity, questions that need to be completed are highlighted in yellow and red color.  As a general rule of thumb, you need to execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.  If something isn't working, it's never a bad idea to click **Kernel** from the file menu, and then **Reset & Clear Output**.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "When finished, download the file as a Notebook(.ipynb) and submit to Sakai.  Be sure to use following the naming convention:  UVID_FINC621_Lab##.ipynb  \n",
    "  \n",
    "For instance, if I were to be submitting the file, it should be named:  fharfoush_FINC621_Lab01.ipynb  \n",
